My personal Klingon Dictionary, typeset in Latex.

I based it off Voragh's Canonical Klingon Dictionary, but I've made many changes. I haven't been super critical yet, so the style and formatting are moderately inconsistent, but the words and meanings should be accurate. I'm only about halfway done with adding all known words, and progress is slow because I am extremely lazy.

# Contributing
The tlhPackage.sty should be self-explanatory. All letter files are kept in tex, and are named in xifan hol, so as to keep their names single letter. This makes them non-alphabetical, but I'm okay with that. I have an order for definitional items: word to be defined, meanings in part-of-word alphabetical order (adverd, noun, verb, etc), references and commentary, canon, Cf., found. Don't fuck that up, and keep everything organized, please.

# Plans
I have this idea that I can write a script to step through some of the various other word lists, and convert or check them against my own. Once qurgh releases his dump of the email archives, I plan on scraping all of Voragh's replies to the Words of the Day and checking that against my own work. Everything takes time, so we'll see.
