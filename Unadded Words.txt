{Hun (n) /Khrun/, type of animal I didn't read that section of the opera myself, but I think I heard someone say it was a fast animal. The khrun is described in other resources as a Klingon riding animal. Note: this isn't the way we saw it in the draft of the opera. After being reminded that the name of the animal had been given a tlhIngan Hol rendering in Keith DeCandido's book "A Burning House", Marc Okrand decided to use the already published spelling.

{nqIq (n) singular one, individual one There were two distinct examples of this word's use seen in the opera. One of them was obviously detailing how a group of warriors was killed one at a time: {ngIq nuv luHoH} "they killed the warriors one by one." The other was a thrice-repeated {ngIq tonSaw lo' 'ej...} "in one single move, he...", making it clear that each of several results was the result of the same action. I surmise that {ngIq} by itself could mean "the one and only". Again, I didn't copy the lyrics, and what I have written here is probably not exactly what was on the pages we inspected.

{pan (v) spark, emit sparks As the duel between Kahless and Molor continues, the opera repeats a phrase several times: {pan qeylIS betleH 'ej jach molor 'etlh} "Kahless's batlh'etlh sparks and Molor's sword roars."

{'o (excl) Oh! {'o} appears before a name used as direct address. As we saw it used, it acted a little like a vocative prefix: {'o qeylIS, qeylIS, qeylIS...} It seems to be an honorific exclamation, or maybe it's just used for direct address in general and doesn't actually have the implication of deference or reverence that I inferred. If it hadn't been consistently present when the opera "speaks to" Kahless, and consistently absent when it "speaks to" Molor, I might have ignored it as an unimportant background sound. English has almost exactly the same sound with pretty much the same meaning: "O Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I am very tired of swimming about here, O Mouse!"
