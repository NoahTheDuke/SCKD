After being reminded that the name of the animal had been given a tlhIngan Hol rendering in Keith DeCandido's book "A Burning House", Marc Okrand decided to use the already published spelling.

The other was a thrice-repeated \tlhw{ngIq tonSaw lo' 'ej...} "in one single move, he...", making it clear that each of several results was the result of the same action.
